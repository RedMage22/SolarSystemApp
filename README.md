# Solar-System-App
A JavaFX application - Explore and learn about the eight planets in our Solar System

## What it does
Enables the user to travel between planets and view information on them.

## How to use it
* Java development kit (JDK) 11 is needed to compile and execute this application.
* Java runtime environment (JRE) 11 is need to run the built application on other machines.
* On startup the application opens with a default orbit view that shows only part of the Solar System.
* A panel of buttons, with the names of each planet, will appear at the bottom of the screen.
* Click on a button to move the camera's view to the desired destination.
* When the camera arrives at a planet's view, the same clicked button can
  be used to view information on the planet and to return to the planet's
  'front' view.
* "ORBIT" button: moves the camera back to its initial view.
